A replication of the paper “How Old Do You Think I Am?”: A Study of Language and Age in Twitter by Dong Nguyen et Al. We performed an Annotation task on Twitter data by manually analyzing a particular tweet's user's Age and Gender. The prediction task was performed using logistic regression and support vector machines.
