# Gender-Age-Predictor

A replication of the paper “How Old Do You Think I Am?”: A Study of Language and Age in Twitter by Dong Nguyen et Al. We performed an Annotation task on Twitter data by manually analyzing a particular tweet's user's Age and Gender. The prediction task was performed using logistic regression and support vector machines.

Note:<br>
-The TweetFinder notebook retrieves tweets which simply contain the word "the". 
-The DataSetFinder notebook retrieves tweets originally annotated by the authors of the paper.
-I was unable to retrieve a lot of the original annotated Tweets since the authors simply stored the Tweet Ids. Most tweets are either deleted or do not exist anymore.
